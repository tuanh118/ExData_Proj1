#Introduction

This is my submission for the first Project the online course "Exploratory Data Analysis" from Coursera.

This assignment requires students to use R's base plotting system to construct some plots from the "Individual household electric power consumption Data Set".

#Files in this repo

* **plot[1-4].R**: R script files that process the data set and produce corresponding plots.
* **plot[1-4].png**: PNG image files that contain the plots.

#How to run

Running each individual R script file will independently download, load and process the data set, then produce corresponding plot and finally export to a PNG image file.
